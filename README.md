# A Simple Blog...

This is a simple blog using Next.js. There is nothing extraordinary here, I just needed something realistic to 
deploy for the Terraform vs. Pulumi YT video.

## Feel free
to clone, fork, copy, steal... It's not my code anyway.

## TL;DR

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run export` (to create the static files to host on a static site provider like S3)

## TODO:

- [ ] Update this README with a link to the video
